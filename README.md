## Description

tests of [LiquidFun](https://github.com/google/liquidfun)

display rendering is done with [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML)


The base class for all tests is the Physics class ([header](include/Physics.hpp) / [implementation](src/Physics.cpp))

### Build instructions

I'll be talking about **linux** and **Windows** here

#### SFML includes

On **linux** if you have installed the sfml library you shouldn't have anything to do, the compiler will find the include files on the system
